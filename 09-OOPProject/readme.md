# Personality Checker CLI

Welcome to the Personality Checker CLI, a command-line interface designed to determine a student's personality based on a series of questions. This project showcases Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with classes like `Person` and `Student`.

## Classes

### 1. Person

The `Person` class serves as the base class, containing properties and methods to handle personality-related functionalities.

### 2. Student

The `Student` class extends the `Person` class, introducing additional features to handle student-specific information. It includes properties like `_name` for storing the student's name, along with getters and setters for convenient access.

### 3. Main

The `Main` class handles the program logic, incorporating the 'inquirer' library for user input. It prompts the user with a personality preference question, creates an instance of the `Person` class, and displays the determined personality based on the user's response.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mubeendev3/typescript-projects.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd 09-OOPProject`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the Student Personality Quiz CLI: `npx ts-node index.ts`
5. Follow the prompts to determine the student's personality.

## How to Use

1. Answer the personality preference question.
2. View the determined personality.
